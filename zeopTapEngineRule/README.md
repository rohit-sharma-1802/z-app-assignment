# Rule Engine Application

## Overview

This application is a rule engine that determines user eligibility based on attributes such as age, department, salary, and experience. It uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent and manage conditional rules, allowing for dynamic rule creation, combination, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Create Rules:** Define rules using a string format that gets converted into an AST.

- **Combine Rules:** Combine multiple rules into a single AST for more complex evaluations.
  
- **Evaluate Rules:** Check if the given data meets the criteria defined by the AST.
  
- **Tree Visualization:** Define or Combine Rule would should show Tree Representation.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
